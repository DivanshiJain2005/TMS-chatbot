            "title": "Study finds possible early predictor of successful transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy for major depression",
            "content": "A new study from UCLA Health researchers demonstrates that a novel treatment is effective in most patients with major depressive symptoms even after multiple failed courses of antidepressant medication. The treatment, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), may work even more rapidly than past findings have suggested, starting to alleviate symptoms as quickly as one week. Researchers from the Neuromodulation Division of UCLA’s Semel Institute analyzed the outcomes of hundreds of patients treated at UCLA Health from 2009 to 2022 with rTMS therapy, which uses magnetic fields to effectively “rewire” the brain’s circuitry. The new study published this week in Psychiatry Research found that 54% of patients exhibited clinical response (at least a 50% improvement) in mood symptoms when examined using multiple depression rating scales. “We have a unique approach to rTMS treatment at UCLA,” said the study’s lead author Dr. Michael K. Leuchter, a senior psychiatry resident at the Jane and Terry Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior. “In our ‘precision TMS’ model, patients see a psychiatrist at every treatment and we measure symptoms weekly with multiple rating scales, following a measurement-based care approach.” This approach allowed UCLA researchers to assess treatment benefit with greater fidelity and accuracy than previous studies using fewer measurement scales. “What we're seeing in our analysis of our large data set is that a majority of patients get significantly better,” Leuchter said. “What’s most exciting to see is that these patients generally start reporting improvement within a week of starting treatment, even though the treatment itself continues for several weeks to build the full benefit.” TMS uses magnetic fields to stimulate brain circuits and can target those involved in mood regulation. Patients generally receive 20-30 minute treatment sessions five days per week for a period of six to eight weeks. Compared to most antidepressant medications, rTMS is relatively new, having been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2008 for treatment of medication-resistant major depressive disorder. The effectiveness of rTMS has previously been observed as quite variable, with reported response rates ranging from 30-60%. Researchers at UCLA have been working to understand this variability and improve predictions of which patients are most likely to benefit from the therapy. Leuchter and his colleagues studied the outcomes of 708 patients treated with TMS for a six-week period at UCLA with four widely used depression rating scales. They found that the depression rating scales that doctors use to assess the effectiveness of the treatment could be a large factor contributing to this variability. Across all four scales studied, researchers discovered that 54% of patients reported a significant response on at least one rating scale. If only one scale was used, up to a third of positive responses to treatment could be missed, according to Leuchter. “Using multiple scales rather than one allows us to better detect and characterize the effectiveness of rTMS treatment for the many different faces of depression,” Leuchter said. Additionally, early improvements reported within five or ten treatments were found to be significant predictors of how well a patient will respond throughout the course of treatment. Leuchter said this could help doctors determine whether or when to modify their clinical approach for a patient."

            "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation: A review of its evolution and current applications",
            "content": "Abstract Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a recently developed noninvasive brain stimulation method for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders. Although its exact mechanism of action is still not clear, current evidence points toward its role in causing long-term inhibition and excitation of neurons in certain brain areas. As evidence steadily grows in favor of rTMS as a therapeutic tool; there is a need to develop standardized protocols for its administration. There have been no reports of any serious side effects with rTMS, though its use is restricted in those having magnetic implants or recent adverse neurological or cardiac events. Of all the psychiatric indications of rTMS, the evidence is most robust for treatment of refractory unipolar depression. This paper reviews contemporary literature highlighting the evolution of rTMS as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool, especially in the management of treatment-resistant depression. Keywords: Long-term potentiation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, treatment-resistant depression Energy is dynamic, has a frequency, can change its form and is electromagnetic (EM) in nature. All atoms, chemicals and cells produce EM fields (EMFs) of their own and all 70 trillion cells in the body communicate via EM exchanges. Disruption of EM flow of energy in cells can cause impaired cell metabolism and may be the underlying cause of any disease process. These principles have led to an explosion of information pertaining to understanding normal and abnormal brain function in the past few decades. Barker et al. discovered the induction of finger and foot movements through the use of magnetic coils placed on the motor cortex. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a neurophysiological procedure for noninvasive stimulation of the nervous system. It involves applying rapidly changing magnetic fields to the superficial layers of the cerebral cortex, which locally induces small electric currents known as “Eddy or Foucault currents.” The cerebral cortex acts as a secondary coil in this situation. TMS has an advantage over electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as it is focused and bypasses the impedance of skull and superficial tissues; therefore, it requires lesser stimulus strength and eliminates any need for true seizures or anesthesia. However, despite evidence supporting its usefulness in selected cases, skeptics continue to question its efficacy and usage; thus repetitive TMS (rTMS) remains underutilized. Therefore, there was a felt need to systematically review data on evolution and use of TMS in treating refractory depression."

            "title": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)",
            "content": "What is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)?\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive treatment that involves using a magnetic coil to influence your brain’s natural electrical activity. This treatment, first developed in 1985, now sees widespread use for a variety of mental health and brain-related conditions.\n\nWhy would a magnet affect how my brain works?\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation relies on two basic principles of physics: electricity and magnetism. These two principles can also work cooperatively, and TMS relies on their ability to work together.\n\nThe space surrounding a magnet is magnetically active, and a magnet’s influence in that space is known as the magnetic field. You can’t see it, but that space still shows the effects of the magnet at its center. When you bring a magnet near something that conducts electricity, the interaction between the conductive item and the magnetic field generates electricity.\n\nSo, why does all that matter? It matters because your brain is electrically active. The brain cells in your brain and nerves (known as neurons) use tiny amounts of electricity to send and relay information throughout your brain and body. Bringing a magnet close to your brain can influence your brain’s electrical activity. That’s why TMS targets specific parts of your brain, especially those related to your emotions, internal decision-making, feelings of pleasure, etc.\n\nHowever, doing TMS requires a magnet that switches on and off. Doing that is possible by using electricity to control when the magnet is on or off. It also requires a magnet that’s much stronger than the average magnet on your refrigerator or that you keep around your home.\n\nDifferent types of TMS\nThere are different ways to perform TMS. They have to do with the magnet’s strength or various ways to apply the magnetic field.\n\nMagnet strength. The unit for measuring the strength of a magnet is the tesla (T). Most TMS magnets generate a magnetic field with a strength of 1.5T to 2T, similar to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. However, the area of the magnetic field is much smaller than it is for an MRI because the TMS magnet is so much smaller.\n\nPulse frequency. Each time the magnetic field turns on and off is a pulse. The number of pulses per second is the frequency (which is measured in hertz, abbreviated Hz). TMS can involve low-frequency pulses at 1 Hz (1 pulse per second) or high-frequency pulses at 5 Hz to 10 Hz (5 pulses per second to 10 pulses per second). TMS that uses repetitive pulses is known as repetitive TMS (rTMS).\n\nPulse patterns. TMS can also use different patterns of pulses for treatment. An example of this is theta-burst stimulation (TBS). During TBS, a triplet of 5 Hz bursts happens, for a total of 15 pulses in a second. Using these burst patterns speeds up treatment, making it about five or six times faster than other methods.\n\nMagnetic coil type and stimulation target. Different kinds of magnetic coils can target different brain structures. Deep TMS (dTMS), which involves an H-shaped helmed coil, targets deeper brain structures than rTMS and TBS. Research shows dTMS is effective in treating conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nWhy is transcranial magnetic stimulation done?\nTMS is often a treatment that can help when other treatment options are unsuccessful. It’s also an important option because it’s noninvasive. That means it doesn’t require surgery, and the entire treatment happens through your skin.\n\nTMS can also offer an alternative to treatments like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), if ECT isn’t an option or isn’t effective.\n\nThe conditions TMS has full approval to treat may vary from country to country. TMS has approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat four conditions:\n\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) (including treatment-resistant depression).\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\nMigraines.\nSmoking cessation.\n\nIn addition to the approved conditions, research is ongoing to see if it can treat other conditions. These include, but aren’t limited to:\n\nAddictions.\nAlzheimer’s disease.\nBipolar disorder.\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD).\nChronic pain.\nEating disorders.\nEssential tremor.\nFibromyalgia.\nParkinson’s disease.\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nSchizophrenia.\nStroke complications.\nTinnitus and auditory hallucinations.\nTraumatic brain injury.\n\nHow often is transcranial magnetic stimulation performed?\nThere’s limited available data on how many people undergo TMS per year. However, TMS is widely available, with accredited and certified providers in dozens of countries worldwide.\n\nProcedure Details\nWhat happens before transcranial magnetic stimulation?\nBefore you undergo TMS, a healthcare provider will probably refer you to a specialist with training and experience in using this treatment. The specialist will also talk to you before treatment to make sure you meet the criteria for having TMS or if there are any conditions or circumstances that mean you shouldn’t receive it.\n\nReasons that you shouldn’t undergo TMS can include:\n\nAny kind of implant that’s electronic or contains magnetic metal. TMS is dangerous for anyone with cochlear implants, metal plates on their skull, etc. TMS involves a powerful magnet, which can pull on any magnetic metal in such implants. That pull could cause severe pain or even injuries if it moves an implant.\nA history of seizures, epilepsy or other conditions/circumstances that affect your brain. While it’s rare, TMS can cause seizures. If you have a seizure-related condition or take a medication that increases the risk of seizure, your provider might recommend changing your medications or trying another treatment method altogether.\n\nIf your provider determines that TMS is a good and safe option for you, they’ll talk with you about the treatment schedule they recommend. TMS takes multiple treatments — typically three to five per week — spread out over several weeks. For FDA-approved protocols for depression, a typical TMS course happens every weekday over six weeks for a total of 30 treatments. However, some newer treatment courses can greatly reduce the course of treatment down to a single week.\n\nBecause there’s some variability in treatment courses, your provider is the best person to explain the recommended course of treatment sessions. They can provide the most accurate information specific to your case.\n\nWhat happens during transcranial magnetic stimulation?\nTMS is a noninvasive procedure. The only thing you might need to do right before the procedure is to take off glasses with metal frames or remove any metallic jewelry items. Removing all metallic jewelry is a safety precaution in case they contain any magnetic metals you don’t know about.\n\nThe magnetic coil for TMS is inside a nonmagnetic case or housing. Some devices use a magnet inside a helmet that you wear. Others have the magnet attached to an extension arm (much like the type of arm that allows a healthcare provider to position an overhead light during a medical procedure). Your provider will have you sit in a specially designed chair underneath or beside the magnet.\n\nOnce you’re seated comfortably, your provider will give you earplugs (or another type of hearing protection). That’s because the sound of the magnet is loud enough to damage your hearing (using hearing protection is also standard with MRI scans for this same reason).\n\nAfter you have hearing protection in place, your provider will position the magnet on your head. That either involves putting on the magnet-containing helmet (with a chin strap, so it stays in place) or positioning the extension arm with the magnet at its end, so the outer case of the magnet is against your face. The specific placement depends on the condition you have.\n\nBefore starting the treatment, your provider will give single-pulse stimulations on your scalp. This helps to find the right location and setting for your treatments. Once the magnet is in position, they’ll start the treatment. Early on, you’ll feel a tapping-like sensation from the magnet as your provider slowly increases the strength of the magnetic pulses.\n\nAs the pulse strength increases, you’ll notice a twitch or movement in your hands, especially in your thumbs. This is normal, and your provider will watch for it because it helps them know when the pulse strength is high enough.\n\nAfter finding and setting the right pulse strength, your provider will have the magnet deliver pulses with a specific timing or pattern. You’ll hear clicking sounds during the treatments as the magnet turns on and off. This is also normal. There may be pauses between a series of pulses. That’s because the electricity that powers the magnet also makes the magnet heat up, and those pauses give the magnet time to cool.\n\nDepending on the type of TMS you’re receiving, including the pattern of magnetic field pulses, the treatment sessions can last anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour. Your provider is the best person to tell you how long a session will take.\n\nTreatments after your first session\nThe sessions that follow the first TMS treatment are usually very similar to — or the same as — the first session. Your provider may make some adjustments to the treatment, depending on changes in your symptoms since the first treatment or side effects that you experienced.\n\nWhat happens after TMS?\nOnce a treatment session is over, you can return to your usual routine or schedule for the day. If you have lingering side effects, such as twitching or unusual sensations in your head or face, your provider may ask you to wait a few minutes before leaving. Most of the symptoms that follow a treatment session are mild and only last a few minutes (more about these under the Risks and Benefits section).\n\nRisks / Benefits\nWhat are the advantages of TMS?\nTMS has several advantages that make it a useful treatment.\n\nIt’s noninvasive. You don’t need surgery for this procedure, and you can go about your day once a session ends. It also doesn’t involve anesthesia of any kind.\nIt’s safe. Seizures are the most common serious side effect of TMS, but these are very rare. Your risk of having a seizure from TMS is less than 0.01% for each session. Other side effects are usually mild and only last a few minutes.\nIt’s effective. The success rates of TMS vary by condition, but the available research clearly shows that it works.\nIt can save lives. One of the key conditions that TMS treats, major depressive disorder, can be so severe that it leads to death by suicide. TMS can save lives when it brings improvements to depression symptoms or causes depression to go into remission entirely.\nIt can work cooperatively with other treatments. TMS often happens along with other treatment techniques, such as medications, mental health therapy and more.\nWhat are the risks, side effects or complications of transcranial magnetic stimulation?\nTMS has relatively few side effects, risks and complications. The most likely serious side effect of TMS is having a seizure. However, these are also extremely rare. The risk of having a seizure from a TMS session is 0.01%, or less than 1 in 10,000.\n\nThe most likely complications, most of which are mild and usually don’t last more than several minutes after a session, include:\n\nHeadaches.\nPain, usually in your scalp or neck.\nDizziness or lightheadedness.\nTingling in the muscles of your face or scalp.\nTemporary tinnitus (ringing in your ears).\nUnusually high sensitivity to sound (hyperacusis).\nRecovery and Outlook\nWhat is the recovery time from transcranial magnetic stimulation?\nMost people can return to their usual activities and routine immediately after a TMS session. Some people may need a few minutes to let side effects pass, but this isn’t common.\n\nWhen To Call the Doctor\nWhen should I see my healthcare provider or seek medical attention?\nYou should see your healthcare provider as recommended for your visits. A key factor in whether TMS works is attending all the sessions as recommended. Missing sessions makes this treatment less effective. You should also contact your healthcare provider if you notice any side effects that are moderate or severe or that linger or don’t get better even a few after a session.\n\nWhen should I go to ER or get emergency care?\nPeople with conditions like major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder have a higher risk of dying by suicide. You should get emergency care if you have disturbing thoughts about harming yourself, including thoughts of suicide or harming others. If you have thoughts like this, you can call any of the following:\n\nNational Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (U.S.). To call this line, dial 988 anywhere in the U.S.\nLocal crisis lines. Mental health organizations and centers in your area may offer resources and help through crisis lines.\n911 (or your local emergency services number): You should call 911 (or the local emergency services number) if you feel like you’re in immediate danger of harming yourself. Operators and dispatchers for 911 lines can often help people in immediate danger because of a severe mental crisis and send first responders to assist.\nAdditional Details\nIs TMS harmful to the brain?\nExperts have performed dozens of research studies on TMS. None of those studies has linked TMS to harmful changes in the brain. There are very isolated cases where people have reported significant side effects. However, such cases are extraordinarily rare, and there are only a handful of such cases where experts concluded that TMS probably or definitely was the cause.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a treatment technique that involves using a magnetic field to influence the electrical activity of your brain. This treatment can help with depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, smoking cessation and migraines.\n\nWhile it isn’t a first-line treatment, TMS does offer hope to people who haven’t seen improvements from other more-common treatments. In the case of severe or treatment-resistant depression, TMS is a treatment with life-saving potential. Experts are also researching whether it can help many other brain-related conditions, opening up the possibilities of even more uses for the treatment."

            "content": "Background:\n\nThis systematic review aimed to evaluate and compare the safety and effectiveness of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) with high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) for individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD).  The study was motivated by the inconsistent findings of prior studies comparing dTMS and HF-rTMS for depression treatment. The researchers hypothesized that dTMS would yield a significantly higher response rate than HF-rTMS in adult patients with MDD.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe objective of this systematic review was to evaluate and compare the safety and effectiveness of dTMS with that of high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS; ≥10 Hz) in individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD).\n\nMethods:\n\nThe review searched Chinese and English databases for RCTs comparing dTMS and HF-rTMS. The overall antidepressant response and remission rates were the co-primary outcomes.  The systematic review included two RCTs that compared the efficacy and safety of dTMS versus HF-rTMS for treating MDD in adults.\n\nResults:\n\nTwo RCTs met the inclusion criteria, with a Jadad score of ≥ 3, indicating high quality. The overall antidepressant response rate was significantly higher in the dTMS group (60.0%) than in the HF-rTMS group (41.7%).  The results of this systematic review showed that dTMS provides a more pronounced overall antidepressant response than HF-rTMS, but causes more muscle twitching/spasms or jaw pain incidences. Both RCTs had similar rates of other adverse events and discontinuation.\n\nConclusions:\n\ndTMS leads to a better antidepressant response than HF-rTMS, although both interventions have favorable safety profiles. However, more RCTs using rigorous methodologies are warranted.  The conclusions of this systematic review are that dTMS is associated with a better antidepressant response than HF-rTMS in adult patients with MDD, although both treatment modalities have favorable safety profiles."

            "content": "Background:\n\nOf late, the interest in accelerated treatment protocols in repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for the treatment of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been gaining momentum. Studies have already found that the patterned theta burst stimulation is non-inferior to the standard high-frequency stimulation in treating depression. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a customized accelerated combination TMS naturalistic setting.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy of our accelerated protocol on the clinical outcomes in MDD and OCD, when the pharmacotherapy is maintained as usual. The outcome measures selected were day 6 Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with 21 items (HAM-D) and day 10 Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) for MDD and OCD respectively, as compared to their day one scores.\n\nMethods:\n\nRetrospective analysis of pre and post-deep repetitive TMS responses in depression and OCD patients was performed. About 391 Depression and 239 OCD patients’ data was analyzed. Customized treatment protocols consisted of twice daily high-frequency stimulations intervened by one theta burst stimulation. The outcome measures were a day six score in depression and a day 10 score in OCD, compared to day one baseline scores.\n\nResults:\n\nThe overall response rate in depression was 60.86%, estimated as a >50% reduction in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) 21 items score, and 62.76% in OCD, estimated as a >35% reduction in the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score. The mean reduction of YBOCS and HAM-D was statistically significant at p<0.0001. Corresponding effect size estimations revealed Cohen’s d value of 1.40 and 1.59, respectively.\n\nConclusions:\n\nThe response rates achieved at day six and day 10 in depression and OCD, respectively, were comparable to previous studies employing standard treatment protocols. The accelerated protocol produced satisfactory short-term clinical outcomes that were effective in the early management of the illness without any serious adverse effects."

            "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation",
            "content": "Overview\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to improve symptoms of major depression. It's called a \"noninvasive\" procedure because it's done without using surgery or cutting the skin. Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), TMS usually is used only when other depression treatments haven't been effective.\n\nThe FDA also approved TMS for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), migraines, and to help people stop smoking when standard treatments haven't worked well. Research continues into other potential uses for TMS, including epilepsy.\n\nWhen used for depression, OCD, and to stop smoking, this treatment involves delivering repeated magnetic pulses, so it's called repetitive TMS or rTMS.\n\nHow it works\n\nDuring an rTMS session for depression, an electromagnetic coil is placed against the scalp of your head. This coil delivers magnetic pulses that stimulate nerve cells in the region of your brain involved in mood control and depression. It's thought to activate regions of the brain that have decreased activity during depression.\n\nYou may also hear the term \"deep transcranial magnetic stimulation\" or \"deep TMS.\" The difference between rTMS and deep TMS has to do with the type of coil used. The deep TMS coil stimulates deeper and wider areas of the brain, compared with rTMS. Deep TMS coils have been FDA-approved for OCD and to stop smoking.\n\nAlthough the biology of why TMS works isn't completely understood, the stimulation appears to affect how the brain is working. It seems to ease depression symptoms and improve mood.\n\nThere are different ways to perform TMS. Methods may change as experts learn more about the most effective ways to perform treatments.\n\nWhy it's done\n\nDepression is a treatable condition. But for some people, standard treatments aren't effective. Repetitive TMS may be used when standard treatments such as medicines and talk therapy, known as psychotherapy, don't work.\n\nTMS is sometimes used to treat OCD, migraines, and to help people stop smoking after other treatments have not been successful.\n\nRisks\n\nRepetitive TMS is a noninvasive form of brain stimulation. Unlike vagus nerve stimulation or deep brain stimulation, rTMS does not require surgery or implanting electrodes. And, unlike electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), rTMS doesn't cause seizures or memory loss. It also doesn't require the use of anesthesia, which puts people in a sleep-like state.\n\nGenerally, rTMS is considered safe and well-tolerated. However, it can cause some side effects.\n\nCommon side effects\n\nSide effects are generally mild to moderate and improve shortly after a session. Side effects decrease over time with more sessions.\n\nSide effects may include:\n\n* Scalp discomfort and pain\n* Headache\n* Tingling, spasms, or twitching of facial muscles\n* Lightheadedness\n\nYour health care provider can adjust the level of stimulation to reduce symptoms. Or your provider may recommend that you take a pain medicine available without a prescription before the procedure. In some people who get frequent headaches or migraines, TMS triggers headaches, so treatments might need to be stopped.\n\nUncommon side effects\n\nSerious side effects are rare but may include:\n\n* Seizures\n* Emotional highs, called mania, particularly in people with bipolar disorder\n* Hearing loss if the ears aren't well-protected during treatment\n\nMore study is needed to determine whether rTMS may have long-term side effects.\n\nHow you prepare\n\nBefore having rTMS, you may need a:\n\n* Physical exam and possibly lab tests or other tests\n* Mental health evaluation to discuss your depression\n\nThese evaluations help make sure that rTMS is a safe option for you.\n\nTell your health care provider if:\n\n* You're pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant.\n* You have metal or implanted medical devices in your body. In some cases, people with metal implants or devices can have rTMS. But due to the strong magnetic field produced during rTMS, it's not recommended for some people who have these devices:\n    * Aneurysm clips or coils\n    * Stents\n    * Implanted stimulators\n    * Implanted vagus nerve or deep brain stimulators\n    * Implanted electrical devices, such as pacemakers or medicine pumps\n    * Electrodes for monitoring brain activity\n    * Cochlear implants for hearing\n    * Magnetic implants\n    * Bullet fragments\n    * Other metal devices or objects implanted in their body\n* You're taking medicines, including prescriptions, medicines available without a prescription, herbal supplements, vitamins, or other supplements, and the doses.\n* You have a history of seizures or a family history of epilepsy.\n* You have other mental health conditions, such as issues with alcohol or drugs, bipolar disorder, or psychosis.\n* You have brain damage from illness or injury, such as a brain tumor, stroke, or traumatic brain injury.\n* You have frequent or severe headaches.\n* You have any other medical conditions.\n* You've had treatment with rTMS in the past and whether it was helpful in treating your depression.\n\nBefore your first appointment\n\nRepetitive TMS isn't invasive, doesn't require anesthesia, and can be performed on an outpatient basis. While you don't need to arrange for someone to drive you home after treatment, you may prefer to be driven home after the first session to get a sense of how you'll feel afterward.\n\nBefore considering treatment, check with your health insurance company to see whether rTMS is covered. Most policies cover rTMS for depression but require certain medical necessity conditions to be met. These conditions include trying a minimum number of antidepressants that have not worked. Repetitive TMS for OCD and for stopping smoking is new enough that most insurance policies don't cover its use for these issues. That may change as its use becomes more widespread.\n\nWhat you can expect\n\nRepetitive TMS is usually done in a health care provider's office or clinic. It requires a series of treatment sessions to be effective. Generally, sessions are carried out daily, five times a week, for 4 to 6 weeks.\n\nYour first treatment\n\nBefore treatment begins, your health care provider will need to identify the best place to put the magnet on your head and the best dose of magnetic energy for you. Your first appointment usually lasts about an hour.\n\nDuring your first appointment, the \"mapping\" process is performed. Here's what you can likely expect:\n\n* You'll be taken to a treatment room, asked to sit in a reclining chair, and given earplugs to wear during the procedure.\n* An electromagnetic coil will be placed against your head and switched off and on repeatedly to produce stimulating pulses. This results in a tapping sensation on your head and a clicking sound, followed by a pause.\n* The coil will be moved around your head and the magnetic energy adjusted to find the location that causes the fingers or hands on the other side of your body to twitch. Once the location is found, a second process of finding the \"motor threshold\" occurs. Strong and weak pulses alternate to determine how much energy is needed to move your fingers or thumb during at least half of the attempts.\n\nDuring each treatment\n\nThe coil placement and dose are usually done only once. This occurs during the first treatment. For all later treatments, the magnet is moved to the treatment position using measurements from the first treatment.\n\nHere's what to expect during each treatment:\n\n* You'll sit in a comfortable chair, wearing earplugs, with the magnetic coil placed against your head. The treatment location of the coil is different from where the coil makes your fingers or thumb move.\n* When the machine is turned on, you'll feel and hear rapid tapping on your scalp. The pattern will be a few seconds of tapping followed by a pause. The pattern will repeat. You may have scalp discomfort and even some pain during the tapping, but not during the pauses. You'll remain awake and alert during the procedure.\n* Depending on the type of stimulation pattern used, the procedure will last 3.5 minutes or 20 minutes. The latest stimulation type is called \"intermittent theta burst stimulation\" and requires only 3.5 minutes. The original rTMS pattern took 37 minutes, but it can be performed in 20 minutes now.\n\nAfter each treatment\n\nYou can return to your normal daily activities after your treatment. You might have a headache for a short time afterward. Between treatments, you can usually expect to work and drive.\n\nResults\n\nIf rTMS works for you, your depression symptoms may improve or go away completely. Symptom relief may take a few weeks of treatment.\n\nThe effectiveness of rTMS may improve as researchers learn more about techniques, the number of stimulations needed, and the best sites on the brain to stimulate.\n\nOngoing treatment\n\nAfter completing an rTMS treatment series for depression, standard care — such as medicine and talk therapy — may be recommended as ongoing treatment.\n\nIt's not yet known if maintenance rTMS sessions will benefit your depression. This involves continuing treatment when you are symptom-free with the hope that it will prevent the return of symptoms.\n\nIf your depression improves with rTMS for at least 2 to 3 months and then you have symptoms later, you can repeat rTMS treatment. Most insurance companies will cover repeat treatment."

            "title": "Is There Evidence for Effectiveness of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders?",
            "content": "Abstract\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), since its introduction in 1985, has been studied for its efficacy in different psychiatric disorders. It has been touted to be an effective treatment modality for major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and in reducing auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia. In this article, the authors outline the research and evidence toward the efficacy of TMS in psychiatry.\n\nIntroduction\nSince the introduction of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in 1938, it has been shown to be very effective in treatment for major depression. It has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of acute mania and, to a limited extent, chronic schizophrenia. But ECT still remains one of the most controversial modalities of treatment in the entire field of medicine. Its proponents swear by it, while its opponents hate it. The movie “One Flew over Cuckoo's Nest,” like many other movies before and after, portrayed ECT as a very crude and cruel method of treatment, which is sometimes abused as a form of punishment for behavior control. There has been a steady decline in use of ECT in clinical psychiatry settings, and it remains one of the most underutilized treatments. Less than eight percent of American psychiatrists use ECT.1\n\nThe introduction of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) have rekindled interest in the use of brain stimulation methods for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. TMS enables the clinician to focally stimulate specific areas of the brain noninvasively and painlessly. The efficacy of TMS in the treatment of depression has been extensively studied. TMS has also been shown to have some beneficial effects in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).2\n\nTMS was introduced in 1985 by Anthony Baker at the University of Sheffield in England.3 It was designed to be a neurodiagnostic tool used to produce an evoked potential in muscle tissue by activating neurons in the motor cortex.3 TMS is based on two basic principles in physics: 1 Ampere's law2 and Faraday's principle of electromagnetic induction.4\n\nAmpere's law states that the magnetic field in the space around an electric current is proportional to the electric current. According to Faraday's principle of electromagnetic induction, a voltage would be generated across a length of wire if that wire was exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field flux of changing intensity.\n\nThe stimulation coil of the TMS instrument consists of multiple wire loops encased in an insulated material. This is connected to powerful capacitors capable of passing a large electrical current through the coil.3 If a pulse of current is passed through this coil and placed over a person's head, it produces rapidly changing magnetic pulses that penetrate the scalp and skull and reach the brain with minimal attenuation.5 When these pulses alternate rapidly enough, a secondary electric current is induced that alters the local electric field in the nerve tissue.4 This leads to depolarization of the underlying superficial neurons.6 High-intensity current is rapidly turned on and off in the electromagnetic coil using discharges from powerful capacitors.6 TMS thus produces brief but very powerful magnetic fields that lead to induction of electric currents in the brain. TMS pulses can be administered repetitively and rhythmically, and this process is called repetitive TMS (rTMS).7 This can be further classified as high frequency rTMS if the frequency is greater than 1Hz, whereas if the speed of stimulation is equal or less than 1Hz it is called low frequency rTMS.8\n\nMajor Depression\nMajor depressive disorder has a prevalence of almost seven percent in the general population.9 Many effective treatments are available, but as many as 30 percent of these depressed patients do not respond to treatment. Brain stimulation techniques are a possible treatment modality that can be used in these patients with treatment resistant depression. There have been more than 20 randomized, controlled trials investigating the efficacy of rTMS in the treatment of major depression. The most common deficiency noted is the relatively small sample sizes of these studies. The sample size varied from 6 to 70. Most of the studies used sample sizes less than 20.8\n\nGeorge, et al.,\n10 studied the efficacies of rTMS in patients with depression in a double-blind crossover design. Twelve patients were given either active rTMS or sham treatment. The study suggested that daily left prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has antidepressant activity.10\n\nKlein, et al.,\n11 in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy of slow repetitive TMS (rTMS) in patients with major depression. Seventy patients with major depression were randomly assigned to receive active rTMS or sham rTMS in a double-blind design. It was shown that patients who received active rTMS had a significantly greater improvement in depression scores compared with those who received sham treatment and provided evidence for the short-term efficacy of slow rTMS in patients with recurrent major depression.11\n\nBerman, et al.,\n12 in a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial, studied the efficacy of rTMS in treatment resistant major depression. Depressed subjects, who had failed to respond to a median of four treatment trials, were assigned in a randomized, double-blind manner to receive either active or sham rTMS. Adjusted mean decreases in HDRS scores were 14.0 (±3.7) and 0.2 (±4.1) points for the active and control groups, respectively (p<0.05). A two-week course of active rTMS resulted in statistically significant but clinically modest reductions of depressive symptoms, as compared to sham rTMS.12\n\nToro, et al.,\n13 studied the efficacy of rTMS in drug-resistant depression. In this randomized, double-blind study,\n40 patients received either active rTMS or sham rTMS to the left prefrontal cortex. The authors of this study concluded that real, but not sham, HF-rTMS was associated with a significant decrease in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and that left prefrontal high frequency-rTMS was effectively associated with antidepressant treatment. But the size effect was small.13\n\nToro, et al.,\n14 in another published study examined the efficacy of high frequency rTMS as add-on treatment to sertraline in the treatment of major depression. The addition of HF-rTMS did not show any benefit in speeding up or strengthening the therapeutic response to sertraline in major depression.14\n\nBoutros, et al.,\n15 compared active rTMS to sham rTMS in a double-blind controlled trial. Twenty-one treatment-resistant depressed patients were randomized to either active rTMS (n=12) or to sham (n=9) treatment. Sub-motor-threshold (MT) stimulation (80% MT) was delivered for 10 consecutive work days while still receiving medications. It was shown that sub-threshold rTMS stimulation for two weeks is not significantly superior to sham treatment for treatment-resistant depressed patients.15\n\nHoppner, et al.,\n16 in a placebo-controlled study compared high frequency rTMS over left versus low frequency rTMS over right prefrontal cortex compared with sham stimulation in patients with major depression. There were no differences in resolution of depressive symptoms between the rTMS procedures. An additional observation made by these authors was that patients with less severe deficits in psychomotor speed and concentration responded more intensively than patients with severe deficits.16\n\nHerwig, et al.,\n17 in a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled pilot study investigated the efficacy of neuronavigated rTMS, guided according to the prefrontal metabolic state determined by positron emission tomography (PET). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with lower metabolic activity compared to the contralateral hemisphere, as determined from PET scans, was selected to receive the real stimulation. The preliminary examination of the data showed that stimulation of prefrontal cortex with rTMS may not be advantageous irrespective of the metabolic state.17\n\nLoo, et al.,\n18 examined the efficacy and safety of bilateral prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for treating resistant major depression in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Nineteen medication-resistant depressed subjects were randomly assigned to three weeks of active or sham rTMS. Bilateral rTMS did not show any superiority to sham in treating resistant depression.18\n\nHansen, et al.,\n19 studied the efficacy of rTMS in patients with major depression. Fifteen inpatients were randomized to receive 15 days of active left prefrontal high-frequency rTMS or sham rTMS, as an add-on to conventional antidepressant treatment. More than 50 percent of the patients receiving real rTMS suffered from local discomfort during treatment. Real rTMS did not add to the efficacy of standard antidepressant medication and thus did not confirm the antidepressant effect of left frontal high-frequency rTMS.19\n\nCouturier20 did a meta-analysis of six studies of the efficacy of rTMS in the treatment of depression. Two of these studies reported a significant improvement in mood symptoms versus sham group. When combined in the meta-analysis with the other four studies. it was shown that rTMS was no different from sham treatment in major depression.20\n\nMartin, et al.,\n8 in a recent meta-analysis of 12 trials, 537 patients, and 3,134 treatment sessions, found high-frequency rTMS to be associated with large reductions in depression symptoms in patients who received real versus sham stimulation.8\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, rTMS has been shown to have an antidepressant effect. The use of rTMS for the treatment of depression has been supported by some of the studies, but the data remains mixed. Many of these studies suffer from the small sample size and lack of adequate controls. Further large-scale randomized studies will be required to draw more definitive conclusions."

            "title": "How Successful Is TMS Therapy?",
            "content": "The success rate of TMS therapy\nMany patients considering TMS therapy want to know the chances of success and what they can expect by undergoing the procedure. Based on the data available from most TMS providers, the success rate stands between 70% and 80%, meaning that most people who undergo treatment experience relief after the treatment. Approximately 50% of patients go into full remission, meaning they become completely asymptomatic after one treatment routine.\n\nTo fully understand the success of TMS, it is vital to learn about the success rate of medication. In a study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, scientists discovered that the medications commonly prescribed for depression, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have a success rate of about 27.5%. However, when an SSRI fails to yield results, as often happens with people with treatment-resistant depression, the success rate of medication goes down.\n\nBy the time that the patient gets to the fourth medication, the effectiveness rate of the next drug is lower than 7%. It takes one or two months to be sure if an antidepressant is working, and patients may end up spending four to eight months on medication trials when remission chances are insignificant. Increased use of medications also means a higher risk of dealing with unwanted side effects of medications, such as nausea, weight gain, headaches, sexual dysfunction, and gastrointestinal discomfort.\n\nMultiple clinical trials have shown that TMS can alleviate treatment-resistant depression successfully and that the outcomes are long-lasting. A nine-week treatment period is necessary to achieve these TMS therapy success rates. Maintenance sessions may also be necessary sometimes. Some people may have depressive symptoms again in the future, and TMS may be required for these individuals a second time.\n\nFactors that affect the success rates of TMS treatment\nThe success rate of TMS treatment varies from person to person, yet TMS is successful for most individuals. However, recent research suggests that there are a few factors that may influence whether a patient responds to TMS treatment.\n\n* Age: TMS has been demonstrated to be more effective in patients under the age of 60.\n* Personality: Those who scored higher on the temperament and character inventory (TCI) personality scale for tenacity (those who are tenacious tend to persevere even when annoyed or weary) responded more swiftly to TMS. Psychiatrists worldwide utilize TCI to determine and categorize personality types.\n* Treatment-resistant level: TMS seems to have a more favorable effect on patients who are resistant to antidepressant medicines, especially those who had tried more than one type of medication.\n* Using antidepressants: Those taking antidepressants while undergoing TMS may have a better success rate. The reason is that both treatments can work synergistically.\n\nTMS is not recommended for individuals with a history of seizures or a permanent metal implant in the head.\n\nTMS works for depression\nThis overview makes it evident that people dealing with treatment-resistant depression need alternatives. The original research for TMS considered patients with low chances of remission and discovered that two-thirds of patients often had successful experiences after undergoing TMS therapy. The researchers found that those who had lost hope due to dealing with anhedonia and had run out of options noticed that they no longer had the symptoms after six weeks.\n\nGenerally, it is evident that TMS therapy is successful in treating major depressive disorder. Although there are currently additional studies for improving the application of TMS for depression, there should be no reservations regarding TMS's effectiveness.\n\nIn conclusion\nIf you want to treat your depression and are worried about the side effects of antidepressants, TMS therapy is a viable alternative. TMS is a non-invasive treatment for depression that delivers magnetic pulses to specific parts of the brain that regulate mood. TMS can help restore mental health to normal and with minimal or no side effects.\n\nIf you are considering this procedure, contact the office to know if you are eligible. The provider will provide you with the necessary guidance and perform the required evaluation before proceeding with the treatment."
